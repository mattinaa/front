## Commit Message Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. Following this format helps us to generate changelogs and automate versioning.

### Format:

- **type**: The type of change you are committing (e.g., feat, fix, docs, chore, style, refactor, test).
- **scope**: Optional. A scope or component affected (e.g., api, ui, config).
- **subject**: A short description of the change, written in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add new feature").

### Examples:
- `feat(auth): add JWT authentication`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
- `docs(readme): update project setup instructions`

### Types:
- **feat**: A new feature or enhancement
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **chore**: Routine tasks like refactoring, dependency updates, etc.
- **style**: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, missing semicolons)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature but improve readability or performance
- **test**: Adding or fixing tests



## Branch Naming Conventions

Branches should be named in a way that clearly indicates the purpose of the branch.

### Format:

- **type**: The type of the branch (e.g., feat, fix, docs, chore).
- **issue-or-task-id**: The ID of the issue or task being worked on (optional but helpful if you are using an issue tracker).
- **short-description**: A short description of what the branch is working on.

### Examples:
- `feat/123-add-login-page`
- `fix/456-correct-header-alignment`
- `docs/789-update-readme`
- `chore/101-cleanup-unused-files`

### Branch Type Key:
- **feat**: New features or functionality
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **chore**: Other tasks such as refactoring, configuration, or testing
